# QuickGenius - Simple and Customizable Password Generator

Welcome to QuickGenius! This web application helps you generate random passwords with ease. You can customize the length, character set, and more to create a strong and secure password for your online accounts. It's 100% open-source. 

## ⚠️ Important Note
QuickGenius is a simple password generator and **NOT** a password manager. It does **NOT** save or store the generated passwords in any database. Please use a dedicated password manager, like [passbolt](https://github.com/passbolt), to store and manage your passwords securely.
